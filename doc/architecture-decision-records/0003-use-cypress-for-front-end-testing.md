# 3. Use Cypress for front-end testing

Date: 2023-04-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In order to make the software maintainable, we need to be able to test the application and its components.

## Decision

We will use Cypress for component and application testing for the web application.

## Consequences

Cypress is a heavier testing application, as it runs the tests within browsers by default. Therefore, this could introduce
inconsistency
